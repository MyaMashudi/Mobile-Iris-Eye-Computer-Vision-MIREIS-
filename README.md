**MIREIS – Mobile-Based Iris-Eye Image Dataset for Non-Cooperative Biometric Systems**

- Total Images: ~4,445 raw iris-eye images
- Participants: 62 Southeast Asian adults (aged 18–70 years)
- Device Used: iPhone 13 (front and rear cameras)
- Image Format: .jpg, native resolution (1170 × 2532 pixels), RGB
- Environment: Controlled indoor and outdoor settings
- Camera-to-Eye Distance: Fixed at 10–15 cm
- No Preprocessing or Annotation: All images are raw and unaltered

Acquisition Conditions (12 scenarios)
Images were captured under realistic, mobile-based challenges:
1. Focused gaze
2. Eye movements
3. Head movements
4. Occlusion by eyelids
5. Occlusion by eyelashes
6. Use of eyeglasses (on/off)
7. Occlusion by hair
8. Lighting reflection (with/without flashlight)
9. Specular reflection
10. Off-axis gaze
11. Poor illumination
12. Poor focus

Dataset Organization
Structured folder hierarchy: grouped by subject and condition
File naming format includes:
1. Device type (IP13)
2. Subject ID (e.g., 029)
3. Eye side (L/R)
4. Camera type (F/R)
5. Sequence number (e.g., 04 or 080)
Example: IP13_029_L_R_04.jpg

Key Features
- Focuses on non-cooperative iris recognition in mobile settings
- Represents understudied Southeast Asian eye characteristics
- Enables benchmarking under real-world noise and variability
- Flexible for custom segmentation, annotation, and augmentation
- Ethical compliance: Approved by UTM Research Ethics Committee
